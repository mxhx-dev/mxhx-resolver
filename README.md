Using a document tree generated by [mxhx-parser](https://github.com/mxhx-dev/mxhx-parser), resolves the symbols that the XML tags, attributes, and text represent.

## Minimum Requirements

- Haxe 4.0

## Installation

This library is not yet available on Haxelib, so you'll need to install it from Github.

```

## Project Configuration

After installing the library above, add it to your Haxe _.hxml_ file.
